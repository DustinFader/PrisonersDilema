Notes:
How about trees of dilemmas? Or other variations of complexity? Instead of specified or uniform groups of dilemmas in focus.

TitforTat works as the best according to the video but might not work well when what is seen may not always be what you think. Hence a bit of forgiveness is nessacery and makes it work better. Tho in real life its not good to have too much forgiveness so future tests with defection and forgiveness. 

- Cooperate
- Defection
- Forgiveness
- Vengeance/Retaliatory

Planned-features: 
- Mixed Groups of players against other groups of players where the games aren't always with the same players.

- Permutations of players with names set to some. Like tit for tat.
Non hard coded. But so far is.

- Color the percent as green if it has more and red if less.

- input the strategy as the name instead of player.

- Put strategies into seperate file.

Current-features: 
- Random or not random of false perspectives of colluding or defects.
Maybe separate values of whether they mistake defects and colludes.
AKA those who are more prone to be pessimistic maybe?

End result is a percentage where the highest is the one with the most score.
